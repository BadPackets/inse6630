	Abstract = {Covert cryptocurrency mining operations are causing notable losses to both cloud providers and enterprises. Increased power consumption resulting from constant CPU and GPU usage from mining, inflated cooling and electricity costs, and wastage of resources that could otherwise benefit legitimate users are some of the factors that contribute to these incurred losses. Affected organizations currently have no way of detecting these covert, and at times illegal miners and often discover the abuse when attackers have already fled and the damage is done.},
